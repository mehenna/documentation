# 1. Creating a Spring IoC container 
		There are two ways to create a Spring IoC container:
			1. Bean factory 		=> Spring recommends  in the additional few KBs of memory that the application context consumes are critical.
			2. Application context  => Spring recommends that you use the application context in all scenarios
			
		-> Bean factory is the basis for all Spring IoC functionality
		  |-> bean life cycle and wiring. Application context is basically a superset
		  |	  of Bean factory with the additional functionality.
		  
# 2. Java configuration for the application context
		-> The following example shows how to create a simple Java context configuration:
				@Configuration 
    			class SpringContext {  }
    		-> The key is the @Configuration annotation. This is what defines this as a Spring configuration.
 
 # 3. How does Spring IoC container know where to search for beans?
  	-> We need to tell the Spring IoC container the packages to search for by defining a component scan. 	
  			@Configuration 
   			@ComponentScan(basePackages = { "com.mastering.spring" }) 
    		class SpringContext {}
